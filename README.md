## About

Designing a neural decoder to estimate the trajectory of a monkey's arm. Neural activity in the form of spike trains is recorded using 98 neural units from a monkey's brain as it repeatedly performs an arm movement task. The monkey repeats the movement 100 times along each of 8 reaching angles. For each trial, the neural spiking data and the arm position are recorded from 300 ms before movement onset until 100ms after movement ends.

The task is to predict the coordinates of the arm in the *x*, *y* and *z* planes given the neural spike train data.
